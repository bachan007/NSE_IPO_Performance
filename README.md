# NSE_IPO_Performance

In this project, i am analyzing the performance of the stocks, listed on NSE in 2022 and storing the report in a PDF file.

To run this project you need to have python3 installed on your system.

Simply clone the project and create a virtual environment using

>> python3 -m venv 'path of environment'

and activate the virtual environment
Install the required libraries using 
> pip install -r requirements.txt

The main file here is info_to_pdf file

You will get a PDF file as output.
